Description/Goals: 
The fifth project has the primary goal of simulating the memory managment
of the OS. We allow for the choice of four different management stratagies.
The first is "First" which finds the first available memory slot and puts the memory there.
The second is "Best" which finds the smallest available block that can hold the new memory.
The third is "worst" which find the worst block and puts the new memory there.
The fourth is "next" which operates simmilarly to first, but it remembers where is left off and continues to try to put the new block in the next available slot.


Implementation:
The implementation of this project is fairly different from the previous projects.
First we do not rely on a queue. We instead use a list which represents the blocks
of memory that we use. We use a structure to handle the block information (containing pointers 
fowards and backwards, the size of the block, if the block is alloced, and the ptr
address to the block) and create and "blocks" as we need them. to run the program, command is of 
the form "./mem -<test/try> <test> <stratagy>" all in lowercase  
 


Testing Results:
Testing was done in a series of steps.
First we did testing using -try flag and using our own test functions so we could get the 
majority of the project working properly. Next we proceeded using -test, using the given test
functions and checking the output. Using the output we were able to narrow down where the bugs lied
and solve the issues.


Bugs:
No known bugs to report
