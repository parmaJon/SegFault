******************************************************/

	The goal of this lab was to creat a process queue. We used a simple UI that works with the terminal. We then needed to enque, deque, delete and list the contents of the queue. 

We used a doubly linked list to implement the queue.
We move data via pointers. Adding data involves a malloc and 	removing data involves a free.
//Testing results
//any bugs?
Completed the isEmpty, isFull, and clear functions
